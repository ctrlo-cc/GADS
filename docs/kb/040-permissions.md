# Permissions and access control in Linkspace

Linkspace enables very fine control over exactly what data users can add, delete, view and update. You control what users can do and see in Linkspace &nbsp;in two ways:

## 1. Field permissions - access controls and approval controls

You control what fields users can view, edit and approve changes on via their membership of user groups. You can create as many user groups as you like, and users can belong to multiple groups. You add and remove users from groups in their user records.

*See:* [Assign users to groups](050-users/030-assign-users.md) and [Set permissions on a field](030-tables/050-fields/050-field-permissions.md)

## 2. System permissions

You control everything else that users can do on the system i.e. delete records, download data, manage user accounts, administer tables, views and graphs, &nbsp;via their individual user permissions.
