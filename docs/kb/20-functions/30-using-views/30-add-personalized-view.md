# Add a personalised view to My views

## Introduction

You can create personalised views of the records in any table to help you focus on the data you need for specific tasks. For each view, you can choose which fields to display, and you can filter the records that you want to include. Personalised views can only be seen by you, and there is no limit to how many you can create.

## To create a personalised view

1. Select the table for which you want to create a view from the **Table drop-down list** at the top of the page.
2. Click **Views** in the main menu and select **Add a view** from the drop-down menu.
3. On the Add a view page, type a name for your view in the **View name** box.
4. Now tick the boxes next to the fields (columns) that you want to display in your view. To select all, click on the check box next to Field name.
5. Next, set up any filters if you want your view only to include records that meet specific criteria. See: Use views to filter your data
6. To set the default order in which you want the final records to be displayed click on the **Add new sort** button. Select the field you want to sort by, and whether you want to display the results in descending or ascending order. Click **Add new sort** again if you want to create a sort within a sort. For example, you can sort by Country, and then sort by the cities within each country. You can continue to add multiple sort criteria in this way.
7. To create your view click the **Save** button at the bottom of your page.

*NOTE: You can also create a new personalised view by modifying an existing view. To do this select **Copy this view** instead of **Add a view** from the **View** drop-down.*
