# Search records

You can use the search box at the top of the records screen to find specific records. The search will only return exact matches, unless you use a wildcard search.

If you want to search across all fields but are not sure of the exact spelling or full term used, you can use the wildcard function. Use the \* to indicate that what you’ve typed is only a part of what you are looking for.

For example, if you wanted to find a specific project, but didn’t know the full project name, you could type the part you do know inside two \*s – i.e. \*Training\*.

The search will return all records where there is a reference to training in the project name, or in any other field. Note that you will only see search results for your current view.
