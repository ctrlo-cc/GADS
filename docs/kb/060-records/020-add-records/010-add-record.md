To add a new record to a Linkspace table:

1. Check that you have the correct table selected from the Table dropdown list at the top of your screen.
2. Select the&nbsp;**Records**&nbsp;tab in the main menu.
2. Select&nbsp;**Add a record**&nbsp;from the dropdown menu.
3. Fill in the fields and click&nbsp;**Save**. You should see a message saying that your “Submission has been completed successfully.”

NOTE: If your new record needs to be approved, you won’t see it included in the table until it has been approved by an administrator. In this case, when you click on Save you should see a message confirming that your record has been submitted for approval.
