# Add a child record

**You can create multiple child records for any record in a table. These can be used to associate records in the same table. For example, you could create a record for a project, and then create a child record each of the work streams within that project.&nbsp;**

1. Click the **Records** tab in the main menu.
2. [Use the search](../100-quick-search.md) box at the top of the page to find the &nbsp;parent record. (If you canâ€™t see the record you want, check that you are in a view that includes the record: click on the Current view dropdown above the table and select the view that includes the record you need.)
3. Clic **Edit** next to the record ID of the parent record.
4. Click the **Action** button and select **Create child record** from the dropdown list.&nbsp;
5. A pop-up screen will ask you if you want to leave this page without saving your changes. Click the&nbsp;**Leave**&nbsp;button.

6. You will be taken to a new screen with the heading&nbsp;*Create child record of [record ID X]*.

7. Tick the fields for which you want to enter &nbsp;new values for the child record. Any fields that you leave unticked will inherit their values from the parent record. &nbsp;

8. Click&nbsp;**Save**. You should see your new record displayed immediately, unless your changes need to be approved. The record ID for the parent record will be listed next to the new record ID for the child record. &nbsp;
