# Add a synchronised record

**To add a synchronised record, your table must contain fields that have been set up to synchronise with fields in another table. (See <u>Add a field</u>)**

When you add a synchronised record, the values for the synchronised fields will be automatically &nbsp;pulled in from the record in the table that you choose to synchronise your record with.&nbsp;

To add a synchronised record:

1. Find the record that you want to synchronise your new record with and note down the **record ID**.&nbsp;

2. Select the table that you want to add a new synchronised record to from the table dropdown list. &nbsp;

3. Click on **Records&nbsp;**in the main menu and select&nbsp;**Add a synchronised record**&nbsp;from the dropdown menu. (You will only see this menu option if the table has synchronised fields set up.)

4. Enter the record ID of the record you want to synchronise your new record with.
5. Click **Save**.

The synchronisation of fields in a synchronised record only works in one direction: no changes that you make in a synchronised record will be passed to the parent table.&nbsp;
