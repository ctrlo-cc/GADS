# Add a synchronised record

**To add a synchronised record, your table must contain fields that have been set up to synchronise with fields in another table. (See <u>Add a field</u>)**

When you add a synchronised record, the values for the synchronised fields will be automatically &nbsp;pulled in from the record in the table that you choose to synchronise your record with.&nbsp;

To add a synchronised record:

1. Click on&nbsp;**Records&nbsp;**in the main menu and select&nbsp;**See records**&nbsp;from the dropdown menu.

2. Find the record you want to copy by using the search box.
3. Click&nbsp;**Edit**next to**&nbsp;**the record you want to copy.
4. On the **Edit record**screen, click the&nbsp;**Action&nbsp;**menu and select&nbsp;**Copy record**&nbsp;from the dropdown.
5. A pop-up screen will ask you if you want to leave this page. Click the&nbsp;**Leave&nbsp;**button.
6. You will be taken to a new screen with the heading&nbsp;*New record copied from record ID [X].*
7. Change any fields you need to change and click&nbsp;**Save**. You should see a message saying that your “Submission has been completed successfully.”

The synchronisation of fields in a synchronised record only works in one direction: no changes that you make in a synchronised record&nbsp;
