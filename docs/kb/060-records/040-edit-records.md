# Edit a record

1. Click the&nbsp;**Records&nbsp;**tab in the main menu.
2. [Use the search](100-quick-search.md)&nbsp;box at the top of the page to find your record. ( If you can’t see the record you want to edit, check that you are in a view that includes the record: click on the Current view dropdown above the table and select the view that includes the record you need.)
3. Click&nbsp;**Edit**&nbsp;next to the record ID of the record you want to edit.
4. Make your changes and click the&nbsp;**Save&nbsp;**button. You should see a message saying that your “Submission has been completed successfully.”

NOTE: If your edits need to be approved, you won’t see them immediately. In this case, when you click on Save you should see a message confirming that your edits have been submitted for approval.
