# Email a group of users

**Linkspace makes it easy to message a group of users that appear in a [person field](../030-tables/050-fields/030-field-types/090-person-field.md). Click on the envelope icon at the top of any person field column to send a message to every user who appears in that column in the current view. Because the email will go only to people who are included in the current view, you can&nbsp;[filter your records](../070-views/040-filtered-view.md) to email only those who meet certain criteria.&nbsp;**

For example, if your table has a person field called *Project leaders*, you can email all the project leaders by clicking on the **envelope icon** at the top of the *Project leaders* column in the table view format.

You could also **[filter your records](../070-views/040-filtered-view.md)**&nbsp;according to certain criteria, then use the same action to message all project leaders whose projects meet those criteria. For example, if you wanted to email all of the project leaders whose projects had budgets over &pound;10,000, you would use a filter to view only those projects where [Budget] greater 10000. In that view you can then click on the envelope icon at the top of the *Project leaders* column to email the leaders of only those projects.
