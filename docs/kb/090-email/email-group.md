# Email a group of users

Linkspace makes it easy to message a group of users that appear in a person field. For example, if your record has a person field called Project leaders, you can email all the project leaders simply by clicking on the envelope icon at the top of the Project leaders column.
What makes it more powerful is that you can filter the list according to certain criteria and then use the same action to message all project leaders whose projects meet those criteria.
For example, if you wanted to email all of the project leaders whose projects had budgets over Â£10,000, you would use a filter to view only those projects where [Budget] greater 10000. In that view you can then click on the envelope icon at the top of the Project leaders column to email the leaders of only those projects.
