# Personal views

**You can create personal views of the records in any table to help you focus on the data you need for specific tasks. For each view, you can choose which fields to display, and you can filter the records that you want to include. Personal views can only be seen by you, and there is no limit to how many you can create. For more information see [Add a view](/set-up-views.md)**
