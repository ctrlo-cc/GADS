# Set up an alert for changes made to fields in a specific view

**You can monitor changes to a table by setting up alerts on a view that includes the fields you want to monitor. You can set up alerts on shared or personal views. &nbsp;Every time a record is added to or deleted from the table, or fields that are included in your view are edited, you will receive an email.**

1. Before you set an alert you need to [add a view](/030-add-views.md) that includes the fields and records you want to monitor. &nbsp;
2. Once you have added your view, click on **Records&nbsp;**in the main menu and select&nbsp;**See records** from the dropdown menu.

3. On the Records page, check that you have the correct view selected in the **Current view** box.

4. Click on the **Manage views**&nbsp;dropdown button and select **Manage alerts**.

5. In the pop-up box, select whether you want to receive notifications **Instantly**or **Every 24 hours**. If you select **Every 24 hours**, you will receive a daily summary email of all the alerts, normally overnight.
6. Click the **Create alert&nbsp;**button.
