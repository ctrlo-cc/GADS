# Choose which graphs you see

Only a table administrator can configure graphs, but any user can choose which of the configured graphs they want to see when they click on the graphs icon when viewing records.

To select the graphs you want to include in your graphs view for a table:

1. Navigate to the records screen by clicking on **Records** in the main menu and selecting **See records**&nbsp;from the dropdown menu.&nbsp;

2. Click on the&nbsp;**Manage views**&nbsp;dropdown button and select&nbsp;**My graphs**.

3. Tick the graphs you want to be able to see. (If there are none listed then none have been configured for that table.)

4. Click **Save**.
