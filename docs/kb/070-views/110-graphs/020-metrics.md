METRICS: Compare graphs against absolute values
Metrics enable a graph’s values to be converted into percentage values, measured against pre-defined values. For example, a graph might have y-axis values of 20, 40 and 50. These could be plotted against metrics of 40, 40 and 200 (which might be targets). In this case, the graph values would be converted to 50%, 100% and 25%.


CREATE A SET OF METRICS

One set of metrics consists of several points to plot a graph against. Only users with permission to configure graphs can create met- rics.

1.	Click the Admin tab in the top navigation and select Metrics from the drop-down menu. (If you can’t see the Admin tab, then you don’t have the permissions to add, edit or delete data fields or graphs.)
2.	Click on Create new metric.
3.	Provide a name for the metrics.
4.	Click Create.


ADD DATA POINTS TO A METRIC SET

1.	Click Edit next to the name of the relevant metric set.
2.	To add a metric point, click Add Item.
3.	To edit an existing metric point, click Edit next to the item.
4.	For each metric point, enter the x-axis value that the metric applies to. The value must be exactly how it is shown on the graph. Also enter the y-axis value that the graph’s value should be ccompared against. Optionally, enter a y-axis grouping value, if the graph in question has a y-axis grouping set (thereby having more than one value per x/y coordinate).
5.	Click the Save button.


DELETE A METRIC GROUP

1.	Click Edit next to the name of the relevant metric set.
2.	Click Delete group.


REMOVE A DATA POINT FROM A METRIC SET

1.	Click Edit next to the name of the relevant metric set.
 


2.	Click Edit next to the item.
3.	Click Delete.
