# Create a graph with metrics

**You can use metrics to create graphs **to monitor goals or progress against key performance indicators (KPIs). Metrics enable you to&nbsp;**compare the total counts or sum of the values on a graph to a set of predefined target values.&nbsp;**

To create a graph with metrics, you need to:

1. Create a metric set
2. Add a series of target metrics to that set.
3. Apply that metric set to a graph.&nbsp;
