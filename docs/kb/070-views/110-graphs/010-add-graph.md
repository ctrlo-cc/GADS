# Set up a graph

Only administrators can set up graphs. Other users can control the data that is included in their graphs by creating personalised views of the data.&nbsp;

To create a new graph:

Click on \*\*Records \*\* in the main menu and select See records from the dropdown menu.

On the Records page, check that you have the correct view selected in the Current view box.

Click on the Manage views dropdown button and select Manage alerts.

1. Click the Admin tab in the top navigation and select Graphs from the drop-down menu. (If you can’t see the Admin tab, then you don’t have the permissions to add, edit or delete data fields or graphs.)
2. Click on Create new graph.
3. Provide a title and a description of your graph.
4. Select the Type of graph: Bar, Line, Donut, Scatter or Pie
5. Define the data fields and values for your graph.
6. Select a field for the X-axis from the dropdown list. This defines the set of values to use for the x-axis (horizontal axis) for a bar, line or scatter graph. For a donut or pie graph, this defines each segment within a ring. The x-axis label will automati- cally be the name of its defined data field. It’s also possible to select all

   <all fields="" in="" view="">, which will show each field in the view as a point on the x-axis. This option is only really applicable when summing fields (see below); a count will produce a flat graph across all points.</all>
7. The X-axis grouping is optional and only relevant to date fields. It lets you group the values that are returned for the x-axis according to day, month or year.
8. From the dropdown list, select the field to use for your Y-axis field. This defines the field to use for the y-values (vertical axis) of a graph. You can ignore this step if you are using a donut or pie graph, or if you want your y-axis to show a total count for each value that appears in the X-axis field.
9. In the Y-axis values box you must choose whether you want the graph to show the total sum of a particular field (for numeric values only), or count the number of times each value appears.
10. If you are using a bar, line or scatter graph, provide a Y-axis label.
11. The Group by field is optional. This lets you group related data items. For example, if countries were being displayed on the graph, this option could be used to group (and colour code) by continent. In the case of a donut graph, this defines the rings. Otherwise, the data being displayed is normally a smaller subset of this grouping option.
12. Select a set of metrics if you want your values to be converted to percentage values compared against a set of fixed values. See the metrics section for more information.
13. Select Stack data if you want different data items for the same x value to be stacked on top of each other, rather than dis- played side-by-side
14. Select Add graph to all users if you want the graph to be displayed in the graph view for all users.
15. Click the Save button at the bottom of the screen.
