# Set up a graph

Only administrators can set up graphs. Other users can control the data that is included in their graphs by creating personalised views of the data.&nbsp;

To create a new graph:

1. Select the table for which you want to create a graph from the&nbsp;**Table dropdown** list at the top of your screen.

2. Navigate to the records screen by clicking on **Records** in the main menu and selecting **See records**&nbsp;from the dropdown menu.&nbsp;

3. Click on the&nbsp;**Manage views**&nbsp;dropdown button and select&nbsp;**Add a graph**.
4. Provide a title and a description of your graph.
5. Select the **Type**of graph: bar, line, donut, scatter or pie.
6. To define the fields and values to include in your graph:
7. Select a field for the X-axis from the dropdown list. This defines the set of values to use for the x-axis (horizontal axis) for a bar, line or scatter graph. For a donut or pie graph, this defines each segment within a ring. The x-axis label will automati- cally be the name of its defined data field. Itâ€™s also possible to select all

   <all fields="" in="" view="">, which will show each field in the view as a point on the x-axis. This option is only really applicable when summing fields (see below); a count will produce a flat graph across all points.</all>
8. The X-axis grouping is optional and only relevant to date fields. It lets you group the values that are returned for the x-axis according to day, month or year.
9. From the dropdown list, select the field to use for your Y-axis field. This defines the field to use for the y-values (vertical axis) of a graph. You can ignore this step if you are using a donut or pie graph, or if you want your y-axis to show a total count for each value that appears in the X-axis field.
10. In the Y-axis values box you must choose whether you want the graph to show the total sum of a particular field (for numeric values only), or count the number of times each value appears.
11. If you are using a bar, line or scatter graph, provide a Y-axis label.
12. The Group by field is optional. This lets you group related data items. For example, if countries were being displayed on the graph, this option could be used to group (and colour code) by continent. In the case of a donut graph, this defines the rings. Otherwise, the data being displayed is normally a smaller subset of this grouping option.
13. Select a set of metrics if you want your values to be converted to percentage values compared against a set of fixed values. See the metrics section for more information.
14. Select Stack data if you want different data items for the same x value to be stacked on top of each other, rather than dis- played side-by-side
15. Select Add graph to all users if you want the graph to be displayed in the graph view for all users.
16. Click the Save button at the bottom of the screen.
