# Create a graph

Only administrators can set up graphs. Other users can control the data that is included in their graphs by creating personalised views of the data they want to see.&nbsp;

To create a new graph:

1. Select the table for which you want to create a graph from the&nbsp;**Table dropdown** list at the top of your screen.

2. Navigate to the records screen by clicking on **Records** in the main menu and selecting **See records**&nbsp;from the dropdown menu.&nbsp;

3. Click on the&nbsp;**Manage views**&nbsp;dropdown button and select&nbsp;**Manage graphs**.
4. Click the&nbsp;**Create new graph** button.
5. Provide a title and a description of your graph.
6. Select the **Type** of graph: bar, line, donut, scatter or pie. Next you need to define the fields and values to include in your graph.
7. Select a field for the **X-axis**&nbsp;from the dropdown list. This defines the set of values to use for the horizontal axis for a bar, line or scatter graph. For a donut or pie graph, this defines each segment. The X-axis label will automatically be the name of the field you choose.&nbsp;
   <br>You can set your X-axis to include *All fields in view.&nbsp;*This &nbsp;will show each field in your view, rather than each value, as a point, bar or segment. This option is only applicable when summing integer fields (*see point 11. below*).
8. If you have selected a date field for your X-axis you can use the **X-axis grouping** to group the values on the graph by day, month or year. Select your preference from the dropdown.
9. The Y-axis **(vertical axis for bar, scatter or line graph)&nbsp;**will by default be a numerical scale against which the count for each value that appears in the X-axis field will be mapped. If that is what you want, then you don't need to select a field for the Y-axis. If you want to sum the total of values in a field you need to select a Y-axis field and this needs to be an integer field.&nbsp;
10. If you are using a bar, line or scatter graph, you can **label your Y-axis**.
11. If the field you have chosen for your Y-axis is an integer, then you can use the **Y-axis values** dropdown choose to either show the total sum of all the values of a particular field rather to count of the number of times each value appears.
12. The **Group by** field is optional. This lets you visually group your results by the values of another field. For example, if you were displaying the total number of students in different *Training regions*(your X-axis field), and you wanted to group the totals in each region by those who were in year 1, 2 or 3 of their course, you could *Group by* the *Year of Study* field. Then you could see how many students in each year you had in each region. In the case of a donut graph, the values of the field you choose to group by will each be represented by another ring of the donut.&nbsp;
13. Tick **Stack values within the same series** if you want the values of your chosen **Group by field**&nbsp;to be displayed on top of each other, rather than displayed side-by-side.
14. Select a metric set from the metrics dropdown if you want your values to be converted to percentages when compared against a set of fixed values. <u>More about metrics</u>
15. Click the **Save&nbsp;**button at the bottom of the screen.
