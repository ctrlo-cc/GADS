# Create a graph

Only administrators can set up graphs. Other users can control the data that is included in their graphs by creating personalised views of the data they want to see.&nbsp;

To create a new graph:

1. Select the table for which you want to create a graph from the&nbsp;**Table dropdown** list at the top of your screen.

2. Navigate to the records screen by clicking on **Records** in the main menu and selecting **See records**&nbsp;from the dropdown menu.&nbsp;

3. Click on the&nbsp;**Manage views**&nbsp;dropdown button and select&nbsp;**Add a graph**.
4. Provide a title and a description of your graph.
5. Select the **Type&nbsp;**of graph: bar, line, donut, scatter or pie.
6. To define the fields and values to include in your graph:
7. Select a field for the **X-axis** **(horizontal axis)**&nbsp;from the dropdown list. This defines the set of values to use for the x-axis for a bar, line or scatter graph. For a donut or pie graph, this defines each segment. The X-axis label will automatically be the name of the field you choose.
   <br>You can also set your X-axis to include *All fields in view.&nbsp;*This&nbsp;&nbsp;will show each field as a point on the X-axis. This option is only really applicable when summing fields (see below); a count will produce a flat graph across all points.

8. The **X-axis grouping** is optional and only relevant to date fields. It lets you group the values for the X-axis according to day, month or year.
9. Select the field to use for your **Y-axis (vertical axis)**. If you are creating a donut or pie chart you don't need to select a field for the Y-axis. If you are using a bar, scatter or line graph the Y-axis will show a total count for each value that appears in the X-axis field.&nbsp;
10. If you are using a bar, line or scatter graph, you can **label your Y-axis**.
11. In the **Y-axis values** box, choose whether you want the graph to show the total sum of a particular field (for numeric values only), or count the number of times each value appears.
12. The **Group by** field is optional. This lets you visually group your results by the values of another field. For example, if you were displaying the total number of students in different training regions, and you wanted to group the totals in each region by those who were in year 1, 2 or 3 of their course, you could group by the *Year of Study* field. &nbsp;In the case of a donut graph, the values of the field you choose to group by will each be represented by another ring of the donut.&nbsp;
13. Tick **Stack values within the same series** if you are grouping your Y-axis values and want different values to be stacked on top of each other, rather than displayed side-by-side.
14. Select a set of metrics from the metrics dropdown if you want your values to be converted to percentages when compared against a set of fixed values. <u>More about metrics</u>
15. Click the **Save&nbsp;**button at the bottom of the screen.
