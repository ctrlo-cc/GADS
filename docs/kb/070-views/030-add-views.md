# Add a view

To create a personal, shared or an administration view:

1. Select the table for which you want to create a view from the&nbsp;**Table dropdown list**&nbsp;at the top of your screen.
2. Click **Records&nbsp;**in the main menu and select&nbsp;**See records** from the dropdown menu.
3. On the Records page, click on the **Manage views&nbsp;**dropdown button and select **Add a view.**
4. Give your view a name.
5. Any new view you create is by default a personal view. If you are adding a shared view or an administration view, tick the relevant box. &nbsp;
6. Tick the boxes next to the fields (columns) that you want to display in your view. To select all, click on the checkbox next to&nbsp;**Field name**.
7. Next, set up any filters if you want your view only to include records that meet specific criteria.*&nbsp;See:*&nbsp;[Use views to filter your data](030-filtered-view.md)
8. To set the default order in which you want the final records to be displayed click on the&nbsp;**Add new sort button**. Select the field you want to sort by, and whether you want to display the results in descending or ascending order. Click Add new sort again if you want to create a sort within a sort. For example, you can sort by Country, and then sort by the cities within each country. You can continue to add multiple sort criteria in this way.
9. To create your view click the&nbsp;**Save**&nbsp;button at the bottom of your screen.

*NOTE:*You can also create a new personal, shared or administration view by modifying an existing view. To do this select&nbsp;**Copy this view**&nbsp;instead of Add a view from the Manage views dropdown button.
