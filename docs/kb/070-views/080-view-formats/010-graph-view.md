# Viewing data from your records on a graph

You can see specific data from your records displayed as graphs by clicking on the graphs icon. Only administrators can set up graphs. Other users can control the data that is included in their graphs by creating personalised views of the data they want to see. Find out how you choose the graphs you want to include on your graphs screen.
