**If any of your records include dates you can use the timeline to see your records. To view your records in the timeline view format, click on the timeline icon at the top of the Records screen.**

In the timeline view format, each date and date range field is shown as a coloured strip on the relevant date(s). You can choose which fields you want to use to label, group and colour your records on the timeline. To do this, click the **Timeline optionsâ€¦** button and select the fields you want to use to label, group and colour your records.

You can see the record in full by clicking on the coloured strip.
