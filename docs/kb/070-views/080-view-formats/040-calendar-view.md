# Using the calendar view format

If any of your views include dates you can use the calendar to see your records. To view your records in the calendar view format, click on the calendar icon at the top of the Records screen. 

In the calendar view format, each date and date range field is shown as a coloured square on the relevant date. Each date field will be in a different colour. You can see further fields for the record when you mouse-over the square. The key for each data field is shown at the top of the calendar.
