# Viewing your records on a calendar

If any of your records include dates you can use the calendar to see your records. To view your records in the calendar view format, click on the calendar icon at the top of the Records screen. 

In the calendar view format, each date and date range field is shown as a coloured block on the relevant date(s). You can see the record in brief by hovering over the block, or in full by clicking on the coloured block.
