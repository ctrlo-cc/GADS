# Control when a field is displayed on the Add/Edit record screen

**You can choose to hide or display a field on the Add a record or Edit record screens according to the value of another field. Only showing users fields that are directly relevant can make your Add/Edit a record screens less overwhelming. Doing this won't limit a user from seeing a field when they are viewing records, only when they are adding or editing them.**

To set the conditions for displaying a field on the **Add a record&nbsp;**or **Edit record screens**:

1. On the Add a field or Edit field screen, tick the box next to **Only display this field under the following conditions**.
2. Select the field on which your condition should be based from the first drop-down.
3. In the second box, enter the required text of an exact match, or use a regular expression to define any other type of match. [More about using regular expressions to match a field value](120-value-matches.md)
