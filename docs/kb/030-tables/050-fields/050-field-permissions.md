# Set permissions on a new field

**There are two types of permissions that you can set on every field:**

* **Access controls - permissions to *read*, *write*and *edit*values in the field and**
* **Approval controls - these govern whose edits need approval and who can approve them. (Setting up approval controls is optional; by default, any user with *edit*or *write*permissions does not need their changes approved.)&nbsp;**

## To set access controls

If you have just created a new field you will have been returned to the **Edit field** screen for the field you have just created.

1. Scroll down to **Permissions** at the very the bottom of the **Edit field** screen.
2. Click on the **Access Control…** button.
3. In the pop-up box, select the group you want to give access to from the drop-down list on the left.
4. Tick the permissions you want to give that group.
5. To add another group, click the + icon on the right.
6. Click **Save**.

## To set approval controls

1. Click on the **Approval Control…** button.
2. In the pop-up box, you will see all the groups that have write and edit permissions. By default, a group with write and/or edit permissions does not need their values approved before they are included in the table. If you want to change this, untick the **No approval required** boxes.
3. Now select which groups are responsible for approving changes by ticking the **Approve new values** or **Approve edits** boxes.
4. To add another group, click the **+** icon on the right. To remove a group, click on the **-** icon.
5. Click **Save**.
