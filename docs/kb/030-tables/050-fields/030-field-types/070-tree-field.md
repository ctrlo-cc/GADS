USE A TREE TO STRUCTURE CATEGORIES AND SUB-CATEGORIES

If you have a number of categories and sub-categories that you want users to choose from in a data field, setting it up as a data tree makes it easier for people to find what theyâ€™re looking for, and eliminates spelling errors.

1.	Add a new data field and give it a name.
2.	Select Tree as the Type of field.
3.	Tick the Only all end-nodes to be selected if you want users to be able only to select the final sub-categories in the tree and not higher-level categories.
4.	Each item in the tree is referred to as a node. Similar to a folder structure on your computer, you create top-level nodes and can then nest other nodes underneath these. To start click the Create button under the Node selection box.
5.	To add a node underneath another node, select the node you want as the parent and click Create again.
6.	To rename or delete a node, select it and click on either the Rename or Delete button.
7.	Set the permissions for the field and click Save to create the new data field.
