# Tree field

**A tree field is a useful way to structure the field values that you want users to choose from into categories and sub-categories. &nbsp;Setting those options up as a data tree makes it easier for people to find the option they are looking for, and it eliminates spelling errors.**

## Set up a tree field

To set up a tree field you need to:

1. [Add a new field](/020-add-field.md) and select&nbsp;**Tree**as your field&nbsp;**Type. &nbsp;**You can only add categories and sub-categories to your tree field once you have saved the field, so complete the rest of the Add a field screen and save your new field.**&nbsp;**
2. After saving your new field you will be on the **Edit field** screen where you will see your&nbsp;**Tree field options**.
3. Each value in a tree is referred to as a node. If you only want users to be able to select end-nodes (i.e. a value from the a final sub-category in the tree) tick **Only let users select an end-node.**&nbsp;
4. Similar to a folder structure on a computer, with a tree, you create top-level nodes and can then nest other nodes beneath them.
5. To start, click the **Add a node** button and type in your first top-level node. It is best to create all your top-level nodes before adding any second-level nodes. (If you forget to add a top-level node, save the field, and return to the Edit field screen to add it.)
6. To add a node underneath another node, click on the node you want as the parent and click **Add a node** again.
7. To rename or delete a node, click on it to select it, and then click either the **Rename**or **Delete**button.&nbsp;
8. Click **Save**at the bottom of your screen once you have created all your nodes.&nbsp;
