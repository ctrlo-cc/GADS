## Dropdown list field

**In a dropdown list field, users can select one or more values from a dropdown list of values.**&nbsp;

## Set up a dropdown list field

When you [add a new field](../020-add-field.md), to set it as a dropdown list field you need to:

1. Select **Dropdown list** as your **Field type**.
2. Set the order in which you want your values to appear by selecting an option from the dropdown list under&nbsp;**Order your dropdown values**.**&nbsp;**&nbsp;
3. Click on the **Add**button under **Add dropdown values&nbsp;**to add values to the list.
4. Type your first value into the text box, and click the **Add**button again. Continue until you have added all your values.&nbsp;
5. If you want to allow users to be able to select more than one value from the dropdown list, you need to tick the box next to **Allow multiple values** at the bottom of the [Add a field](../020-add-field.md) screen.
