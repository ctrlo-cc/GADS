# Imported values field

**If you set up an imported values field, users can select values that are pulled in from records in another table. These values can be presented as a dropdown list, or used to create an autocomplete text box. &nbsp;You can select the fields and filter the records that you want to use to provide your values.**

To create an imported values field you need to select the field type :

1. Select the radio button to set whether a user can choose the correct value from a dropdown list or type into an autocomplete text box.&nbsp;
2. Click the radio button if you want to **override user permissions** that exist for the table and the fields that you want to pull into the field. For example, you would have to select this if your users don't have read permissions on the table you are referencing.&nbsp;
3. Select the table you want to use from the **Use this table** dropdown.
4. Tick the fields you want to include in your field.
5. If you want to, you can then filter the records you want to include. More about filtering your records.&nbsp;
