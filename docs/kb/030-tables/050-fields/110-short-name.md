# Giving your field a short name

You can give any field a short name, which you can use to reference it within calculations for [calculated fields](../../../../../030-field-types/110-calculated-field.md) or [RAG fields](../../../../../030-field-types/100-RAG-field.md). The short name must be unique, must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers and underscores.
