## &nbsp;

To add a new field:

1. Click the&nbsp;**Table editor**&nbsp;tab in the main menu and select&nbsp;**Add a field**&nbsp;from the drop-down menu. You will be presented with the&nbsp;**Add a field&nbsp;**screen.
2. Give your field a name. You can use spaces and special characters in field names. The field name will appear at the top of the column in your table.
3. Select the&nbsp;**Type of field** from the drop-down list and complete the options for that field type. [More about field types](030-field-types/010-field-types.md)
4. Fill out the **Description** field to clarify what this field refers to. The description is only visible to other table administrators.&nbsp;
5. If you want to, you can give your field a&nbsp;**Short name**. You can use this when referencing the field in a calculation. More about short names
6. You can opt to&nbsp;**synchronise this field with a field of the same type in another table**. This synchonisation of fields will only be activated when you <u>add a synchronised record</u> to the table.&nbsp;
7. You can also add **Help text for the user**. This will be displayed in a pop-up box when a user clicks on the question mark (?) next to the field name. Use it to provide guidelines or answer any common questions a user might have about that values they must enter.
8. Tick the box if you want the **field to be optional**. By default any field you create is mandatory. (Mandatory fields will all be displayed in bold),
9. Tick the box if you want Linkspace to **remember and display the last value** that was typed in for that field when a new record is added.
10. Tick the box if you want all **values for the field to be unique**.
11. If you want to, you can set the conditions under which you want the field to be displayed. This enables you to display fields based on values a user enters for another field.&nbsp;[More about controlling when a field is displayed](040-field-display.md)
12. Click&nbsp;**Save**. You should see an on-screen notification that your field has been created and you need to set permission for this field. Until you set permissions for the field it will not be displayed in the table.
