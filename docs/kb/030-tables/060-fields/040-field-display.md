# Control when a field is displayed&nbsp;

**You can choose to hide or display a field on the Add a record or Edit record screens according to the value of another field. This can make your Add/Edit record screens less overwhelming, by only showing users fields that are directly relevant. Note that setting a condition for display won't affect if a user sees a field when they are viewing records, only when they are adding or editing them.**

To set the conditions for displaying a field on the **Add a record&nbsp;**or&nbsp;**Edit record screens**:

1. On the Add a field or Edit a field screen, tick the box next to Only display this field under the following conditions.
2. Select the field on which your condition should be based from the first drop-down.
3. In the second box, enter the required text of an exact match, or use a regular expression for any other type of match.
