# How groups work

Linkspace enables very fine control over exactly what data users can add, delete, view and update. You control what users are able to do and see on the Linkspace system in two ways:

1.	You control what data fields they can view, edit and approve changes on via their membership of user groups – See: Set per- missions on a data field.


You add and remove users from a group in the individual user records. 

There are no system-wide field permissions associated with groups. You need to specify the permissions that each group has for each field. You can see an overview of a group’s permissions across all fields by going to Users > Groups
