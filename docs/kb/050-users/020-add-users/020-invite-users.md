# Invite users to sign up to your Linkspace

Linkspace users can request an account through your Linkspace login screen.

Direct users to your login URL and ask them to click on the **Request account** button.

You will be alerted to any new account requests. (You can disable this function on your Linkspace system if you prefer.)
