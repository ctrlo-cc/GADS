If you are an administrator responsible for approving new users you will receive an email alert when a new user requests a user account. To approve the request:

1.	Click the Admin tab in the top navigation and select Manage Users from the drop-down menu. (If you canâ€™t see the Admin
tab, then you do not have the permissions to add, edit or delete users.)
2.	New Account requests are displayed below the list of Active accounts.
3.	Click on the ID of the user you wish to approve.
4.	Click Approve to activate the account.
