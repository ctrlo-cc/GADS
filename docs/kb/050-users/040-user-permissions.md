# Set user permissions

## Controlling the fields users can read, write and edit

You control what fields users can view, add to and edit by adding them to groups. On each field you can then set permissions for each group.

*See*:[ Set permissions on a field](../../../../030-tables/050-fields/050-field-permissions.md)

## Controlling the tables users can see

As well as using groups and field permissions, you can also control which tables users can see. You set this on their user record page by selecting the tables that the user should be able to see from the dropdown list.

*See:* [Add a new user to Linkspace](020-add-users/010-add-user.md)

## Setting a user's general permissions

Administrative permissions, and permissions that apply across tables are also set on a user's record page. These are:

* delete records but requires approval
* delete records without approval
* download data
* bulk update records
* add, edit and delete tables and fields
* add, edit and delete graphs and shared views
* create child records and edit fields of existing child records
* link records between tables
* access user logs audit data
* manage other user accounts
* send messages
