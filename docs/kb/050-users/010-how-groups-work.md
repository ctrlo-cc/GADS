# How groups work

**There are no system-wide field permissions in Linkspace. You control which fields users can read, write and edit through their membership of user groups.**
{: .present-before-paste}

For every field, you need to specify the permissions that a group has for that field.
{: .present-before-paste}

You can create as many user groups as you like, and users can belong to multiple groups. You add and remove users from groups in the individual user records.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

You can see an overview of a groupâ€™s permissions across all fields by going to Users &gt; Groups
