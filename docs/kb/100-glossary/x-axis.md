X-axis

The X-axis of a graph in Linkspace is the field you choose to define the values for the horizontal x-axis for a bar, line or scatter graph. Each set of values will be displayed as a separate vertical bar, a point or segment on the graph. For a donut or pie graph, each segment will represent a different set of values.
